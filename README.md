# The Language Insights Project

The language insights project (code named `linsights`) is a research project
started in the Fall of 2016 as a part of the Signature Inter-disciplinary
Research Areas (SIRA) initiative at the
[Rochester Institute of Technology](http://www.rit.edu). The short term goal of
this project is to gain an understanding of the natural language
characteristics of conversations that software developers have about source
code.


## About this Repository

The repository is host to a Django application developed to support the data
collection and analysis for the language insights project.
